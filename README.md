## Ludum Dare 48 Entry

The first version of this game was a Ludum Dare game jam entry. And you can find it here: https://github.com/vexorian/dig-deeper-and-deeper . There are few differences. The name has changed so that it doesn't conflict with the LD submission. There's also more polish and the levels are different. I feel these mechanics still have plenty of *depth* to explore.
